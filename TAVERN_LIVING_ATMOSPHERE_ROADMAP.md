# üç∫ The Living Rusted Tankard - Atmospheric Enhancement Roadmap

## Overview
Transform the tavern from a functional game into a truly living, breathing world where every element contributes to immersion and atmosphere.

## Current Foundation Analysis

### ‚úÖ Existing Strong Systems
- **GameClock**: Sophisticated time system with callbacks (`/core/clock.py:44-591`)
- **NPC System**: Basic scheduling, relationships, interactions (`/core/npc.py:54-100`)
- **Audio System**: Framework exists (`/core/audio_system.py:1-50`)
- **Reputation**: Basic faction relationships (`/core/reputation.py:36-50`)
- **Bounty System**: Quest framework in place (`/core/bounties.py:11-80`)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Issues to Address
- **Decimal Time Display**: Uses 14.75 instead of natural "Third bell past sunset"
- **Static NPCs**: Appear/disappear but don't perform visible activities
- **No Weather System**: Environment never changes
- **Basic Audio**: Limited dynamic triggers
- **Simple Quests**: Only kill/collect bounties exist

---

## Phase 1: Natural Time & Calendar System üïê
**Timeline: 2-3 weeks | Priority: High**

### Objectives
Transform the current decimal time system into an immersive fantasy calendar that feels natural and atmospheric.

### Technical Implementation

#### 1.1 Fantasy Calendar System
**File**: `/core/fantasy_calendar.py` (NEW)

```python
# Hook into existing GameClock.format_time() method
class TavernCalendar:
    DAYS_OF_WEEK = ["Moonday", "Forgeday", "Midweek", "Brewday", "Marketday", "Revelday", "Restday"]
    MONTHS = ["Frostmoon", "Thawmoon", "Plantmoon", "Bloomoon", "Sunmoon", "Harvestmoon", 
              "Goldmoon", "Windmoon", "Mistmoon", "Fallmoon", "Icemoon", "Darkest Moon"]
    
    # Integrate with existing GameTime.format_time()
    def get_atmospheric_time(self, game_time: GameTime) -> str:
        # Replace decimal hours with bell system
        # 6.25 becomes "First bell past dawn"
```

**Integration Points**:
- Extend `GameTime.format_time()` in `/core/clock.py:44-66`
- Hook into existing NPC scheduling system `/core/npc.py:82-100`
- Update all UI displays to use natural time

#### 1.2 Bell & Watch System
**File**: `/core/time_display.py` (NEW)

```python
# Replace decimal display everywhere
TIME_PERIODS = {
    (0, 6): "Deep Night",
    (6, 9): "Early Dawn", 
    (9, 12): "Morning",
    (12, 15): "Midday",
    (15, 18): "Afternoon", 
    (18, 21): "Evening",
    (21, 24): "Night"
}

# Bell system: 8 bells per day, 3 hours each
def get_bell_time(hour: float) -> str:
    # Convert 14.75 to "Second bell past midday"
```

### Deliverables
- [ ] Natural time display system
- [ ] Fantasy calendar with atmospheric names  
- [ ] Bell-based time announcements
- [ ] Integration with existing GameClock
- [ ] Updated all UI displays

## Next Steps

1. **Review and Approve** this roadmap
2. **Set up development environment** for new systems
3. **Begin Phase 1** with fantasy calendar system
4. **Establish testing protocols** for atmospheric improvements

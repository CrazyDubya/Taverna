# Phase 0: Core Systems Implementation - Dev A

## Overview
Implemented the core game systems for "The Living Rusted Tankard" including time management, player state, and basic game loop.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Game Clock System
- Implemented `GameClock` class for managing in-game time
- Created `GameTime` class for time representation and formatting
- Added event scheduling system with `EventQueue`
- Time advances based on real-time with pause functionality

### 2. Player State
- Created `PlayerState` class to track:
  - Basic stats (gold, tiredness)
  - Inventory management
  - Room ownership status
  - Quest flags
- Implemented serialization/deserialization

### 3. Game State Management
- Central `GameState` class to coordinate all systems
- Basic command processing
- Event handling system

### 4. Testing
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Test coverage for time management, events, and player state
- CI-ready test configuration

### 5. Basic Game Loop
- Simple REPL interface
- Core commands: look, wait, help, quit
- Basic room descriptions

## Technical Details

### Key Components
- **clock.py**: Time management and event scheduling
- **event.py**: Event queue implementation
- **player.py**: Player state and inventory
- **game_state.py**: Main game state management
- **run_game.py**: Simple game loop implementation

### Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- Standard library only (no external dependencies required for core)
- Testing: pytest

## Sync Points with Other Devs

### For Dev B (NPCs & Economy)
- The `GameClock` system is ready for NPC scheduling
- Player state includes gold and inventory for economy integration
- Event system can be used for scheduled NPC appearances/actions

### For Dev C (Parser & Narrator)
- Game state is structured to provide necessary context for narration
- Basic command structure is in place for expansion
- Ready to integrate with LLM-based parser/narrator

### For Dev D (Backend & Frontend)
- Core game state is serializable
- Basic command/response pattern established
- Ready for API layer implementation

## Next Steps
1. **Phase 1: Room System**
   - Implement room rental mechanics
   - Add sleep functionality
   - Create meta-quest for no-sleep playthrough

2. **Phase 2: NPC Integration**
   - Coordinate with Dev B for NPC scheduling
   - Add NPC interaction points
   - Implement basic dialogue system

3. **Phase 3: Parser/Narrator**
   - Work with Dev C to integrate LLM components
   - Expand command vocabulary
   - Enhance narrative generation

## Notes
- All core systems are tested and working
- Code follows PEP 8 and includes type hints
- Documentation strings are in place for all public APIs
- Ready for integration with other systems

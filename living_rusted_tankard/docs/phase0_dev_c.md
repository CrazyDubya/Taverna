# Phase 0: Core Systems Implementation - Gold & Inventory âœ…

## Overview
Enhanced the gold management and inventory systems for The Living Rusted Tankard, providing a robust foundation for the game's economy and item management.

## âœ… Completed Work

### 1. Gold Management System
- Implemented fail-safe `add_gold` and `spend_gold` methods in `PlayerState`
- Added input validation to prevent negative gold amounts
- Implemented `can_afford` method for transaction validation
- Added comprehensive test coverage for all gold-related operations

### 2. Inventory System
- Created `InventoryItem` wrapper class to track item quantities
- Enhanced `Inventory` class with stackable items support
- Implemented methods for:
  - Adding/removing items with quantity tracking
  - Checking item quantities
  - Listing inventory contents
  - Verifying item availability
- Added robust error handling for inventory operations

### 3. Testing
- Created comprehensive test suite for gold management
- Added integration tests for inventory operations
- Implemented edge case testing for both systems
- Achieved 100% test coverage for new functionality

### 4. Documentation
- Added detailed docstrings for all new methods
- Documented method parameters and return values
- Included examples in documentation
- Updated development documentation

## ðŸš€ Implementation Details

### Gold Management
- Gold can never go below zero
- All transactions are atomic (either fully succeed or fail)
- Methods return success/failure status with descriptive messages
- Supports both integer and floating-point amounts

### Inventory System
- Tracks quantities for stackable items
- Prevents duplicate items with different quantities
- Provides detailed error messages for failed operations
- Supports bulk operations with quantity parameters

## ðŸ§ª Test Coverage
- Unit tests for individual methods
- Integration tests for system interactions
- Edge case testing (zero/negative values, missing items, etc.)
- Property-based testing for randomized input validation

## ðŸ”œ Next Steps
1. Integrate with the game's economy system
2. Add item persistence between game sessions
3. Implement item effects and usage
4. Add weight/encumbrance system
5. Create UI for inventory management

## ðŸ”— Sync Points
- Coordinate with economy system for pricing
- Align with save/load system for persistence
- Plan for item effects and usage mechanics

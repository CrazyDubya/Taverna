- ✅ Uses `threading.RLock()` for general synchronization
- ✅ Uses `threading.Lock()` for statistics protection
- ✅ Thread-safe accessor methods for shared resources
- ✅ Proper concurrent request handling

## Phase 1.2: Enhanced Persistence Layer ✅ COMPLETED

### 💾 Versioned Save System
**Status: COMPLETED**

**Achievements:**
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive versioned save format

- ✅ Added backup/restore functionality
- ✅ Built save validation and corruption detection
- ✅ Support for multiple save formats (JSON, compressed JSON)

**New Components Created:**
```
core/persistence/
├── __init__.py              - Package exports
├── save_manager.py          - Main save/load interface
├── migrations.py            - Version upgrade system
└── validation.py            - Save integrity validation
```

**Key Features:**

**Migration Support:**
- Player structure upgrades (reputation, memory, achievements)
- NPC enhancements (relationships, secrets, motivations)
- Economy system extensions (market trends, transaction history)
- Room system improvements (atmosphere, secrets, events)
- Time system enhancements (scheduled events, time scale)

## Phase 1.1: Remaining Tasks

### 🚧 Comprehensive Error Handling
**Status: PENDING**

**Next Steps:**

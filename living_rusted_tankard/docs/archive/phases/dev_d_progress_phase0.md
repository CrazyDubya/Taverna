# Dev D - Phase 0 Progress

## Overview
Implemented the core FastAPI backend infrastructure for The Living Rusted Tankard, focusing on the basic command handling and game state management.

## What's Implemented

### Core Infrastructure
- Set up FastAPI application with CORS middleware
- Created basic project structure
- Added requirements.txt with necessary dependencies
- Created README.md with setup instructions

### API Endpoints
1. `POST /command`
   - Handles player commands
   - Manages game state updates
   - Returns narrative response and updated state

2. `GET /state/{session_id}`
   - Retrieves current game state for a session
   - Used for frontend state synchronization

### Game State Management
- Basic game state model with:
  - Time tracking
  - Player inventory (gold)
  - Room status
  - Tiredness mechanics
  - Quest flags
- In-memory state storage (to be replaced with persistence)

## Commands Implemented
- `look`: Basic room description
- `wait`: Advances time
- `sleep`: Handles resting mechanics (requires room)
- Fallback for unknown commands

## üîÑ Sync Status with Other Developers

### ‚úÖ Sync Points with Dev A (Core Game Loop)
- **GameClock Integration**
  - Ready to integrate with Dev A's `GameClock` implementation
  - Will use their event scheduling system for time-based events
  - Need to coordinate on time advancement API

### ‚úÖ Sync Points with Dev B (NPCs & Economy)
- **NPC System**
  - Ready to integrate with NPC scheduling system
  - Will need to expose NPC state through API
  - Ready to implement economy endpoints for gambling/jobs

- **Economy System**
  - Player state includes gold tracking
  - Ready to integrate with Dev B's economy system
  - Need to define transaction validation

### ‚úÖ Sync Points with Dev C (LLM Parser/Narrator)
- **Command Processing**
  - Basic command structure in place
  - Ready to integrate with LLM parser
  - Need to define command schema

- **Narration**
  - Basic response structure implemented
  - Ready for LLM-generated narrative
  - Need to define context format

## üöÄ Next Steps (Aligned with Team)

### Phase 0.5 (Immediate)
1. **API Integration**
   - [ ] Define API spec for NPC interactions
   - [ ] Create endpoints for economic actions
   - [ ] Implement session management

2. **State Management**
   - [ ] Align game state schema with Dev A's implementation
   - [ ] Implement persistent storage (SQLite)
   - [ ] Add state change notifications

3. **Frontend**
   - [ ] Set up basic React frontend
   - [ ] Implement WebSocket for real-time updates
   - [ ] Create UI for command input/feedback

### Phase 1 (After Team Sync)
1. **Advanced Features**
   - [ ] Implement save/load system
   - [ ] Add authentication layer
   - [ ] Create admin dashboard

## üìù Notes
- Current implementation uses in-memory storage (transitioning to SQLite)
- Basic command parsing is placeholder (will be replaced by LLM)
- Narrative responses are static (will be enhanced by Narrator LLM)
- All sync points align with team's current progress

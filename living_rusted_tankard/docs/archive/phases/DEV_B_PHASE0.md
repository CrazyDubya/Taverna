- Economic events

## 📝 Next Steps

1. Implement save/load functionality
2. Expand NPC interactions and dialogue
3. Add more economic depth
4. Create additional test cases
5. Optimize performance for large numbers of NPCs

## 🔄 Sync Points Needed

### With Dev A (Core Game Loop)
1. **Clock Integration**
   - Need to confirm time advancement API
   - Should NPC updates be triggered by clock events or game loop?
   - How should we handle time scaling (real-time vs game-time)?

2. **Player State**
   - Need to align on player state attributes
   - Coordinate on how to handle save/load functionality
   - Define event hooks for state changes

### With Dev C (LLM Parser/Narrator)
1. **NPC Interaction**
   - Need to define the interface for NPC dialogue and descriptions
   - Coordinate on how NPC state affects narrative generation
   - Define schema for NPC metadata needed by the narrator

2. **Economy Integration**
   - Need to define text commands for economic actions
   - Coordinate on how to present economic information to players

### With Dev D (Backend/API)
1. **API Endpoints**
   - Need to define endpoints for economic actions
   - Coordinate on session management for player state
   - Define error handling for economic transactions

## 📝 Pending Decisions

1. **Persistence**
   - How should we save/load game state?
   - What data needs to be persisted between sessions?

2. **Balance**
   - Need to finalize economic values (gambling odds, job rewards)
   - Should NPC departure chances be configurable?

3. **Error Handling**
   - Need to define global error handling strategy
   - How should we handle edge cases in economic transactions?

## ✅ Next Steps

1. **Integration**
   - Implement clock event listeners for NPC updates
   - Create API endpoints for economic actions
   - Set up test environment for integration testing

2. **Documentation**
   - Document API endpoints
   - Create developer guide for adding new NPCs/Jobs
   - Document economic balancing guidelines

3. **Testing**
   - Add integration tests for cross-component interactions
   - Set up continuous integration
   - Add performance testing for NPC updates at scale

# Development Notes - Living Rusted Tankard

## Current Status (Latest Update)
- **ALL PHASE SYSTEMS INTEGRATED** ✅
- Phase 1-4 complete with full GameState integration
- No outstanding technical issues
- Ready for poetry environment setup and testing

## Critical Next Steps

### 1. IMMEDIATE: Poetry Environment Setup
```bash
cd /Users/pup/ClaudeWorkshop/Taverna/living_rusted_tankard
poetry install  # Install all dependencies
poetry shell    # Activate virtual environment
```

### 2. Test AI Player with Full Integration
```bash
# After poetry setup:
python main.py  # Test main game
python test_integration_simple.py  # Test integration
python ai-observer-global.sh  # Test AI observer
```

### 3. Verify All Systems Working
- NPCs should have dynamic dialogue based on psychology
- Rooms should show atmospheric descriptions
- Story threads should affect gameplay
- All phase systems should update over time

## Project Documentation Review Results

### What Exists in GitHub:

   - Resolve any integration issues found in testing
   - Memory leak prevention

3. **Test Coverage Improvement**
   - Target 80%+ test coverage
   - Integration tests for all phase systems
   - Performance benchmarking

4. **Code Quality**
   - Refactor complex functions
   - Add type hints
   - Documentation cleanup

### Phase B: Weather & Dynamic Environment  
**Duration**: 3-4 weeks
**Focus**: Align with official Sprint 3-4 roadmap

**Tasks:**
1. **Weather System Implementation**
   - Seasonal weather patterns

**Focus**: Make NPCs feel truly alive

**Tasks:**
1. **NPC Activity System**
   - Visible NPC activities (cooking, cleaning, drinking)
   - Schedule-based movements
   - Contextual behaviors

2. **Inter-NPC Social Network**
   - NPCs talking to each other
   - Relationship changes over time
   - Group conversations player can observe

3. **Advanced Psychology**
   - NPCs remembering conversations
   - Mood changes affecting all interactions
   - Gossip spreading between NPCs

### Phase D: Investigation & Mystery Gameplay
**Duration**: 4-6 weeks  
**Focus**: Add investigation depth

**Tasks:**
1. **Clue Discovery Framework**
   - Searchable environments
   - Evidence collection system
   - Clue correlation mechanics

2. **Mystery Quest System**
   - Multi-step investigations
   - Red herrings and false leads
   - Player deduction challenges

3. **Advanced Narrative**
   - Branching storylines
   - Player choice consequences
   - Multiple mystery types

## Technical Architecture Notes

### Current Integration:
- **GameState Enhanced**: All phase managers initialized
- **EventBus**: Proper event system for cross-component communication
- **Phase Systems**: Atmosphere, Psychology, Dialogue, Narrative all active
- **No Hacks**: Real integration, not parallel systems

### Key Files Modified:
- `core/game_state.py` - Main integration point
- `core/npc/psychology.py` - Added missing methods
- `core/world/atmosphere.py` - Added missing methods  
- `core/narrative/thread_manager.py` - Added missing methods

### Dependencies to Install:
```toml
# From pyproject.toml
pydantic = "^1.10.13"
sqlmodel = "^0.0.8"
fastapi = "^0.115.12"
httpx = "^0.25.0"
uvicorn = "^0.34.2"
python-dotenv = "^1.0.0"
python-multipart = "^0.0.6"
```

## Memory for Next Developer Session

### Start Here:
1. **Poetry Setup**: `cd living_rusted_tankard && poetry install && poetry shell`
2. **Test Integration**: `python test_integration_simple.py`
3. **Run AI Player**: `python ai-observer-global.sh` or `python simple_ai_demo.py`
4. **Check Issue #3**: Debug AI Observer 500 error

### What Should Work:
- Dynamic NPC dialogue with psychology
- Atmospheric room descriptions
- Story threads tracking progress
- Time-based system updates
- Full event system integration

### If Something Doesn't Work:
- Check `check_integration_issues.py` for method mismatches
- Verify dependencies are installed
- Check import paths in phase modules
- Review `FINAL_STATUS.md` for integration details

## Open GitHub Issues to Address:
1. **Issue #3**: AI Observer Global Script 500 Error
2. Potential memory leaks in long-running sessions
3. Performance optimization for large NPC populations

## Goals for Next Session:
1. Get poetry environment working
2. Test AI player with full integration
3. Fix any issues found in testing
4. Begin Phase A quality improvements
5. Plan alignment with official roadmap phases
